# Megaline-EDA-Hypothesis-testing

**Background:** This project was developed for the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.

**Overview:** This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing for Megaline, a telecommunications company offering two prepaid plans: the Surf plan and the Ultimate plan. The analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior and comparing the profitability of the two plans to support the advertising department in making data-driven decisions about budgeting.

**Key Skills & Concepts:**

* EDA & Data Cleaning: Cleaned and preprocessed client data to ensure accuracy, checking for missing and duplicate values, and correcting data types.
* User Behavior Analysis: Investigated customer patterns such as call durations, message usage, and internet consumption for both prepaid plans.
* Profitability Comparison: Compared the revenue generated by the Surf and Ultimate plans to identify which plan is more profitable.
* Hypothesis Testing: Performed hypothesis testing to assess whether the revenue generated by the two prepaid plans differs significantly and to test regional revenue differences.
* Data Visualization: Created plots and visualizations using Matplotlib to represent call durations, internet consumption, and profitability trends over time.

**Key Insights:**

* Ultimate Plan Users: Customers on the Ultimate plan tend to have longer average call durations, send more messages, and use more internet data compared to Surf plan users.
* Seasonal Trends: Both plans show increasing average call durations from January to December, suggesting a seasonal trend in user behavior.
* Call Duration Distribution: Surf plan users have positively skewed monthly call durations, with most users making fewer than 430 minutes of calls per month.
* Revenue Comparison: Hypothesis testing revealed that the Ultimate plan generates significantly more revenue than the Surf plan.
* Regional Analysis: No significant revenue differences were found between the NY-NJ area and other regions.

**Tools Used:**

* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): Data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
* Statistical Testing (SciPy): Hypothesis testing to compare revenue between plans and regions.
